# harmony-highlighter

This is a simple syntax highlighter for the Harmony concurrent programming language used in CS 4410/4411 at Cornell University.

## Features

- Basic syntax highlighting:
  - Control statement keywords such as `for`, `while`, `if`, `else`

  - Numerical values, `True`, `False`

  - Parentheses, brackets, comments

  - Some built-in functions, such as `assert` or `choose`

Supported on `.hny` extension files.

## Known Issues

This is a relatively simple syntax highlighter that may not have captured all of the features in the language. Updates to this extension will include highlighting for such features.
