# harmony-highlighter

## Deprecated Notice

This extension is now deprecated, and a new updated extension has been made to substitute it. All new work will be done in that extension.

For new features and updates on the Harmony programming language extension, install the HarmonyLang extension, which can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kevinsun-dev-cornell.harmonylang).

## Summary

This is a simple syntax highlighter for the Harmony concurrent programming language used in CS 4410/4411 at Cornell University.

## Features

- Basic syntax highlighting:

  - Control statement keywords such as `for`, `while`, `if`, `else`

  - Numerical values, `True`, `False`

  - Parentheses, brackets, comments

  - Some built-in functions, such as `assert` or `choose`

Supported on `.hny` extension files.

## Known Issues

This is a relatively simple syntax highlighter that may not have captured all of the features in the language. Updates to this extension will include highlighting for such features.

### Contributing

The code is hosted in this [repository](https://github.com/ayang4114/harmony-highlighter). Feel free to fork the project and make pull requests to update the syntax highlighter.

**Enjoy!**
